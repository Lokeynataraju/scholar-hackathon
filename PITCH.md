# 🎓 Scholar-SBT: The Future of Academic Verification
### Trustless, Instant, and Permanent Credentials on Algorand.

## 🛑 The Real-World Problem
We are solving the **Crisis of Credential Fraud** and the **Inefficiency of Verification**.

1.  **Fabricated Degrees**: In India alone, there are thousands of cases of fake degrees every year. Photoshop makes it easy to forge a PDF certificate.
2.  **Verification Hell**: Employers spend weeks and pay third-party agencies just to verify if a candidate actually graduated.
3.  **Loss of Records**: Paper certificates get lost, damaged, or destroyed in disasters. Universities close down, leaving students with no proof.
4.  **No Ownership**: Students do not own their data. They have to beg universities for transcripts every time they apply for a job.

## ✅ The Solution: Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)
Scholar-SBT uses **Algorand Blockchain** to issue **Soulbound Tokens**.

### What is an SBT?
*   It is a digital token that represents a credential (degree, certificate, award).
*   **Soulbound**: It acts like a badge sewn onto your uniform. It **CANNOT be transferred** or sold. You earned it; it stays with you.
*   **Burnable**: Only the issuer (University) can revoke it if a mistake was made, but the student cannot trade it.

### How it Solves the Problem:
1.  **Tamper-Proof**: Once minted on Algorand, the record is immutable. No Photoshop can change a blockchain transaction.
2.  **Instant Verification**: An employer can scan a QR code and verify the credential in **0.5 seconds** at **Zero Cost**. No phone calls, no emails.
3.  **Permanent**: The record lives on the blockchain forever, even if the university website goes down.
4.  **Student Sovereignty**: The student holds the credentials in their own wallet. They are the true owners of their achievements.

## 🛠️ How It Works (The Workflow)

1.  **Watch & Learn**: Student watches educational content (e.g., "Physics 101").
    *   *Proof of Watch* ensures they actually completed the material.
2.  **Claim**: Once completed, the Smart Contract works.
    *   It checks eligibility.
    *   It **Mints** a ScholarSBT to the student's address.
3.  **Verify**: The Student shares their QR Code (Profile).
    *   Employer scans it.
    *   The App reads the blockchain directly.
    *   **Green Checkmark**: The credential is real.

## 🌍 Why Algorand?
*   **Speed**: Verification is instant (3.3s block time).
*   **Cost**: Minting a credential costs fractions of a cent ($0.001), making it scalable for millions of students.
*   **Carbon Negative**: We are saving paper and using a green blockchain.
